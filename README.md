# My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio

I am interested in Data Science because for me, data science was a way to become a detective. For every new case, you have to go into a new field to try to understand how it works, to massage the data until you understand them, to try to acquire all the knowledge of the field without being a specialist. And because I am very curious about very different techniques in science, for me, it is exactly what I wanted.
My Program is about Python function that takes a sequence of numbers and determines whether all the numbers are different from each other.
